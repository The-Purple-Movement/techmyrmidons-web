# Introduction to Qubits

A **qubit** (quantum bit) is the basic unit of information in quantum computing.  
Unlike a classical bit that can only be **0** or **1**, a qubit can be in **0**, **1**, or a **superposition** of both states at the same time.

## ðŸ§  How Qubits Work

A qubit uses the principles of quantum mechanics:

- **Superposition** â†’ allows qubits to be 0 and 1 simultaneously  
- **Entanglement** â†’ qubits can be linked together so that the state of one affects the other instantly  
- **Measurement** â†’ observing a qubit forces it into either 0 or 1

Mathematically, a qubitâ€™s state is written as:

\[
|\psi\rangle = \alpha|0\rangle + \beta|1\rangle
\]

Where:  
- \(\alpha\) and \(\beta\) are complex numbers  
- Probability must satisfy:  
  \[
  |\alpha|^2 + |\beta|^2 = 1
  \]
